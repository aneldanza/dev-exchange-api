### Authentication

#### JWT Token Authentication with HTTP-only Cookies using Devise and devise-jwt

This application uses `devise-jwt` for authentication, and the tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies to enhance security.

#### How It Works

- **Login**: When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT token and sends it back to the client in an HTTP-only cookie.
- **Authenticated Requests**: For subsequent requests, the client sends the HTTP-only cookie containing the JWT token. The server verifies the token to authenticate the user.
- **Logout**: To log out, the client can clear the HTTP-only cookie.
