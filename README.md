### Authentication

#### JWT Token Authentication Devise and devise-jwt

This application uses `devise-jwt` for authentication, and the tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies to enhance security.

#### How It Works

- **Login**: When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT token and sends it back to the client.
- **Authenticated Requests**: The client includes a header containing the JWT token for subsequent requests. The server verifies the token to authenticate the user.
- **Logout**: The client can clear the token from local-storage to log out.
